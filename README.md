# freeOTPtoBase32
Convert OTP secrets stored in the android version of freeOTP back to their Base32 formats

This is a thing that I wrote in order to deal with managing two-facter authentication with multiple programs on multiple devices.
This program is made public in the hopes that someone else will also find it useful. This software comes with no warrenty.
If I may make a sugestion, \**Capslock engage*\* DO NOT DELETE YOUR ORIGIONAL FREEOTP TOKENS.XML FILE ON ACCOUNT OF MY PROGRAM. \**disengage*\* If there is a bug in my software which renders your accounts inaccessable, -> :'(

Enjoy :)

P.S. Be careful where you put your *\*Expletive*\* tokens. :)
