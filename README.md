This is a thing that I wrote in order to deal with managing two-facter authentication with multiple programs on multiple devices.
This program is made public in the hopes that someone else will also find it useful. This software comes with no warrenty.
DO NOT DELETE YOUR ORIGIONAL FREEOTP TOKENS.XML FILE ON ACCOUNT OF MY PROGRAM. If there is a bug in my software which renders your accounts inaccessable, i am not responsible.

Enjoy :)

P.S. Be careful where you put your tokens. :)
